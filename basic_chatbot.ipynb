            "Gen AI models typically use deep learning algorithms, particularly a type called **generative adversarial networks (GANs)** or **transformer networks**.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **GANs** consist of two networks: a generator that creates content and a discriminator that evaluates its authenticity. They compete against each other, improving the quality of the generated content over time.\n",
            "* **Transformer networks** are particularly good at understanding and generating sequential data like text. They use attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, allowing them to capture complex relationships and generate coherent text.\n",
